A hangman game built using React.js.

# Final Implementation

The Game has 3 difficulty Modes:
* Easy
* Medium
* Hard

There are atleast 2 topics in each difficulty mode you can choose from. As soon as you pick a topic from any difficulty mode, a random word from that topic is picked by random and the game starts. You can enter any letter to start playing. If you get 6 guesses wrong, the game ends and you lose.
